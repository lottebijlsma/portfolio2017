<div class='about-tekst-section'>
<p class='about-txt'>My name is Lotte Bijlsma. I'm currently a <strong>Devine</strong> student at the University College of Howest in Kortrijk, Belgium. Devine is the place where I can combine both my design and development skills to create awesome digital products.
<br/><br/>
<p class='about-txt'>Besides my studies, I have worked for Little Miss Robot and the University College of Howest. In my spare time you can find me blogging about either <a class='about-link' href='botanical.lottebijlsma.be'>my plants</a> or <a class='about-link' href='blog.lottebijlsma.be'>other stuff</a> that interests me, collecting typography at <a class='about-link' href='https://www.instagram.com/be.typo/'>BE.Typo</a>, messing around with motion graphics or embroidering.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p class='about-txt'>Feel free to send me an e-mail at <a class='about-link' href="mailto:bijlsmalotte@gmail.com">bijlsmalotte@gmail.com</a>. You can also find me on Dribbble, Behance or Github. Oh btw, here's my resume!</p>
