My name is Lotte Bijlsma. I'm currently a **Devine** student at the University College of Howest in Kortrijk, Belgium. Devine is the place where I can combine both my **design** and **development** skills to create awesome **digital products.**


Besides my studies, I have worked for Little Miss Robot and the University College of Howest. In my spare time you can find me blogging about either [my plants](https://botanical.lottebijlsma.be), [my old work](https://thelabtory.tumblr.com) or [other random things](https://blog.lottebijlsma.be), you can find me collecting typography at <a href='https://www.instagram.com/be.typo/'>BE.Typo</a>, messing around with motion graphics or embroidering.

Feel free to send me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:bijlsmalotte@gmail.com">bijlsmalotte@gmail.com</a>. Oh and just in case you might need it someday, here's my [resume](/resume.pdf)!
