<div class='about-tekst-section'>
<p class='about-txt'>Hey there! My name is Lotte, I'm a <strong>Devine</strong> student at the University College of Howest in Kortrijk, Belgium. Devine is the place where I can combine my <strong>design</strong> and <strong>development</strong> skills to create the most epic <strong>digital products.</strong> My passion lies within the design spectrum of my studies, but I am certainly not scared away by the thousands line of code.</p>
<br/>
<p class='about-txt'>Besides my studies, I have worked for Little Miss Robot, Hogeschool West-Vlaanderen and  Crammerock. In my spare time you can find me collecting and experimenting with typography at be.typo, embroidering or messing around with motion graphics.</p>
