## Brief & Concept

The brief was to create a Google Doodle about a day or an event in the future that has some meaning to you (or pick teacher's day if you wanted to suck up to the teachers ðŸ˜‰).

My first decision was to go with Kingsday, but eventually, the creativity didn't strike and my time was running out. I decided to change my subject to the summer solstice. I get shivery really quickly and every time I see a blanket (even if it's 25 degrees), I love to snuggle up underneath it. So I guess you could say that I love warmth and that's important to me, reason enough to create this doodle about it.

When I think about summer, I think about the sea, beaches, sunglasses and most importantly ice cream. These are the things I really wanted to incorporate. I was lucky with Google's colors, because they are already very bright and colorful, so I could definitely use them in my project.

On the first try, I had my go with the original font, but I felt like it wasn't playful enough, so I decided to make it rounder. I showed it to my teachers and agreed with me that the second one seemed more playful, fun and summery, while still being recognizable as Google.


Then, I got to animating. I wanted to keep it simple so that it wouldn't be an explosion to the eye. I think the animations are really well-balanced and flowy. The timing is just right.
