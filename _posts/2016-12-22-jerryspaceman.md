**Team:** Lotte Bijlsma & Julie van Beethoven

**Brief:** Create an *endless game* with a score system and several *power-ups*. You'll have to be able to see the score in a *leaderboard*. So save the score into a database and fetch it. This project is a group-project, so you'll have to work together trough Github.

**Concept:** "Jerry: The Spaceman" is an endless platform game made with Phaser. It is Jerry's goal, and now also yours, to stay in space forever. You can achieve this goal by *avoiding the meteors* that are heading for Jerry. Save him from seeing stars by jumping up and down / moving left and right.

We wanted to make it *extra cool*, so we implemented the experimental *Gamepad API*. If you own a compatible controller (xbox, playstation, ...) and use a compatible browser, you can guide Jerry through the stars with the joystick!
