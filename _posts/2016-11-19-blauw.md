**Brief:** The *local beer brand 'Blauw'* wants to approach all clubs / organizations in West- and Oost-Vlaanderen to give them the opportunity to have the *best day of their lives*. The motto of the competition is *"Meer Blauw op tafel"*, which literally translates to "More Blauw on the table". (It's actually a reference to the saying: "More blue on the streets", in which blue refers to cops, so that's a funny twist). Anyway, we had to design and develop a kickass and absolutely crazy *contest site.* We also had to figure out a nice prize for the contestants (Well, an extra awesome prize, because if they win, they win 10 crates of Blauw beer anyway, I mean how can you top that right).

So, we had *just one week* to design and develop this absolutely crazy ass contest site. The *requirements* were a working form, form validation in JavaScript and PHP and some CSS3 animations. It didn't need to be responsive.
