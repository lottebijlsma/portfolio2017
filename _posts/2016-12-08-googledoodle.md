**Brief:** As a member of the Google motion design team, You get (besides a big salary and free Kopi Luwak double espresso shots) the chance to design a new *Google Doodle*! You pick an event or day in the future that has some meaning to you. Or if you really want to suck up to the teachers, you pick teachers day ;)


**Concept:** I chose not to suck up to the teachers and picked *'the first day of summer'*. I really can't stand the cold, so heat means a lot to me. I think that's a good enough argument to get started.
