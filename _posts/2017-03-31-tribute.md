**Team:** Lotte Bijlsma (conceptual, lead and motion designer) & Jesse de Boitselier (developer)

**Brief:** Radio Nostalgie is known for being the only radio station in Belgium that will play the classics all day long. Music from the 70s, 80s and 90s, non-stop. Pay tribute to an artist of choice in the form of a one-pager. This one-pager will have to be (very) interactive and will have to contain a long-read of approximately 1500 words about a certain section of the artist's life.

**Concept:** We were given a list of about six different artists. Out of that list, we chose Christa 'Nico' PÃ¤ffgen, mostly known for her work with The Velvet Underground, but she did way more. We wanted to reflect on her whole career on this article (also because we couldn't find very much information about her on the internet, or maybe I'm just a lousy researcher haha). This is why the style we chose is based on her whole life, not her crazy ass wild years with The Velvets and not her even crazier solo career. We wanted to implement it all.
