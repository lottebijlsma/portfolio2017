**Brief:** Look for a place / event / ... where you can get in trouble (e.g. a family party). Think of *five problems* that can occur at that time and place and look for *creative solutions*. The visitors of your site will have to be able to *vote* on the most creative solution for that problem.

**Concept:** I had no clue what to do it about in the first place. Then I kinda just stumbled upon modern art musea and thought that could be an interesting subject. Go check it out online and see what the hell could go wrong in a museum.
