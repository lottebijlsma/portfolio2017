**Brief:** Make a *fresh and modern product site* for the *Fjällräven* collection of your choice. You can choose between "City Explorer" or "Back to School". Make sure the user is informed extensively about the backpacks and is encouraged to buy it. Address your target group the right way and respect Fjällräven's branding.

**Concept:** My collection of choice was the *back to school* collection, which included the following backpacks: Foldsack No. 1, Briefpack No. 1 and the Laptop Case 15".
My target group are youngsters who go to high school / college and newly-graduates. I performed some research and came to the conclusion that youngsters didn't really care about the ecologic side of Fjällräven, they just cared if the backpack looked *cool enough* to wear. So I focused on that, together with durability, comfort and weatherproofness.
