**Competition:** Kunstwerkt organised a *competition* for the famous Kandinsky. Yes, that's right, the founding father of abstract art! They wanted to do something special, because this year he would have become *a 150 years old!* Everyone between 18 and 30-something could create an artwork for his upcoming birthday. The only rule was to pick one (or multiple) pictures of Kandinsky that they had selected.

**Concept:** I decided to go with *"Daddy Abstract: Katdinsky Blue III"*. Kandinsky is seen as the founding father of abstract art, also his favourite color was blue. Don't ask me why. The "kat" part you'll see in a second. Unfortunately, I didn't win, but hey, it's not the winning, it's the taking part in competitions like these that counts!
