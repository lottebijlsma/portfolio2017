## Brief & Approach
The brief was to come up with a concept for a **paranormal app**. Even though it's paranormal, the app has to be **credible**. This means that it should have a **realistic purpose** and the users can eventually use it without some hocus pocus.

I really loved this brief. Although I am not a firm believer of the paranormal and my knowledge is very limited, I am interested in it. This made it easier for me to come up with a concept.

Have seen some concepts of past year, I wanted to create something **original**. Not the weather prediction by cats or foods kinda thing. This is why I went to the library. I dug up some **Norse Mythology** books and decided, after hours of browsing that the **nine worlds in Norse cosmology**, together with Yggdrasil would be my main focus. I immediately connected this with meditating, and to give it an extra paranormal touch; I connected it further with **astral projection** (out of body experiences).

Next, I did some full on **research** about Yggdrasil and the 9 dimensions, astral projection, runes and astral projection methods, which you can read [here](link) (it's Dutch). After my research, I already started to feel this mood in my head so I created a **mood- and styleboard**. The styleboard being heavy influenced by illustrator [Marina Muun](http://www.marinamuun.com/), see images below. After this, I **wrote out** my full **concept** with all of the wanted features, made some flowcharts and started sketching out some wireframes. Interested in my research? You can read all about it [here](link). Then, I was finally able to start with the design!

## Concept
Meditating is big nowadays (see for example Headspace). **Drasil is an app that helps people astral project (meditate) to other dimensions**.
Due to the **multiple projection** methods, you get a **personalized** plan that fit your needs. If one method doesn't fit, just choose another and off you go. The app is connected to the tree of life, **Yggdrasil**. Due to this connection you can travel to one of the accessible dimensions with your **astral body**. The app also comes with some **quick meditating options** for when you're stressed out and in a rush, so you can take a deep breath and conquer the world again.

## Screens

Out of some research I did, the iPad is currently both a **lean-forward** and **lean-back** experience. In this case, I will **focus on the lean-back experience**. It's important with meditation that people relax and **take time** for it. This is why I chose the **iPad** as main medium. You can see some screens right here; the technique screen, settings, worlds screen and worlds detail.
