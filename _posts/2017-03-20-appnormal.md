## Brief & Concept

The brief was to come up with a concept for a paranormal app. Even though it's paranormal, the app has to be credible. This means that it should have a realistic purpose and the users can eventually use it without some hocus pocus.

I really loved this brief. Although I am not a firm believer of the paranormal and my knowledge is very limited, I am interested in it. This made it easier for me to come up with a concept. I wanted to do something special.
