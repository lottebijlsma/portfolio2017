## Brief

MSK Ghent gave us the task to figure out why the people of Ghent didn't come to the museum as often as the tourists were. Part of the task was to come up with a **solution** for this problem, it could be anything. From an app to a print campaign, but the only requirement was to have at least something digital (because Devine is a digital oriented).

## Research

Immediately after the brief, we went wandering in the streets of Ghent to ask the people some **questions**. The most important questions were these three:  

- Do you know any musea in Ghent? If yes, do you know the MSK?
- Do you know where it is situated?
- Have you been there? If yes, what was the occasion, if no; why not?

<br/>
After interviewing people on the streets for approximately one and a half hour, we decided to get together and compare results. The following came out of it. The people of Ghent **weren't motivated** or interested enough to go to a museum in their own city. They don't really know what the MSK exactly is, what you can do over there and they think it's full of **dusty old canvases** that are very boring. A lot of them didn't really know that MSK existed, most of them knew it as **"The building across the street from the S.M.A.K.** (another museum)". Roughly 65%- of the people who went there, either went with school or another institution, the rest went out of their own interest. What also stood out is that a lot of people **definitely wanted** to go to the MSK, but they **didn't want to go alone** or couldn't find anyone to go with. So first of all we can conclude out of this that there's a need of more advertising (in the spaces where people often come) and that we need **to push them** to either find someone to come with or to come alone.

## Conceptual brainstorming
The first week was mostly spent **brainstorming** about a concept, which was really hard. At the end of the week we had to pitch two concepts. Our approved concept is **Kunst.klik**, a Tinder-like app, where people match based on **mutual interests** and find their **museum buddy**. The core function of the app is, unlike Tinder, not to find romance, but to find company. We know that an app is risky, because they're getting less and less popular by the minute, but we still wanted to implement one, because it's easier than a website if you're in the flow of finding a new buddy weekly. To cover that big threshold of downloading the app, we made a **website**, with a sneak preview of the app on it. On the website you can do a match-quiz and, just as in the app, you will get matched with your matching buddy! On this website there's also some advertising for the app itself.

How do we get people to the website? By communicating in the city itself, we want to **trigger people** to go to the website to try the matching system out. This on the basis of **fun posters** and an **installation** (which works the same as the site and app), but is more physical and very fun to try-out.

Since we only had **10 days** left after coming up with the subject. We focussed mainly on creating the app and installation itself. The posters and website were pushed back a little. This because they know we are able to create a quick website, so it wouldn't be that bad if the actual website was not finished.

## Style analysis

MSK's corporate identity has recently changed. Their style is really **simple** and a bit **minimalistic**. They only use the colors bright red, white and black. With their new corporate identity, MSK wants to focus on minimalism (letting the work speak for itself) and typography. They try to find a **balance between white-space, text and images**. This is very hard because they often have to communicate big blocks of text. We wanted to stay true to the minimalistic and typographical focus of MSK; but we **added some color**. We changed the red, because it seemed to harsh in our eyes, added some soft pinks and some bright blues.

## Kunst.klik the app

As already mentioned, the flow of the app is based on the most known dating app in this country, Tinder. 80% of the Tinder users are people within the age range of 16-35 years. The conclusion of this is that we can be sure our target group is familiar with the flow of our app. (Interested in the code of Kunst.klik the app? I'll gladly share that one with you, just send me an e-mail.

## Old media

We need to make the MSK more known to the people of Ghent. First of all we start with old media in the city itself. We're placing side by side posters in visible places around Ghent. One typographical and one visual poster are placed next to each other. On the typographical one, there's a sentence with Ghent's dialect which refers to Tinder. In this way, people immediately get the matching process. Underneath there's a link to the app / website. The visual poster contains a painting with a mirror placed on the face of the painting. This should catch the eye of the passerby and will take care of some fun social media shots.

## Installation
I will not go any further into the installation, because the matching process is basically the same story. But here are a couple of sketches of how it can look. There will be buttons instead of an app and at the end you can find your physical match when the lights above your head light up in the same color as your match's.

Because we are not carpenters, we used what we know best and 'faked' it using [socketing](https://damp-tundra-98852.herokuapp.com/). Socketing was something we had **zero experience** with before this, but we wanted to go the extra mile and do something very cool. If you're interested or curious about the code behind this, you can see it on our [MSK Installation repo](https://github.com/NeleDB/MSK-Installation).
