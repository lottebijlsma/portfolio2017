**Brief:** Think of a *truck festival* (no, not a food truck festival). Create around *five trucks* and make sure they have something to offer (either a workshop or a product). Make sure it's original. Each truck should sell two things and you have to be able to buy it online.

**Concept:** I decided to go with *Bakkie Troostival*. Bakkie Troostival is a festival where the Flemish (or other foreigners) can get to know the *Netherlands* and get to persuaded to move there (because it's so good). I am Dutch myself so I took the concept a little lightly and gave it an ironic twist. Go check it out online!
